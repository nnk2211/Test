Great! Here's a full set for your PR:

PR Title:

feat(ci): store Turbo cache to main key on push to avoid unnecessary E2E reruns


---

Commit Message (single line):

store Turbo build cache under main key on push to improve E2E suite efficiency


---

PR Description:

Implemented a CI enhancement to improve Turbo cache reliability and avoid unnecessary E2E test runs.

What’s changed:

Added a push trigger to the workflow

Introduced a new store-main-cache job that runs only on push to main

This job stores the current .turbo directory using a turbo-e2e-main cache key


Why:

E2E tests on PR approval run against the merged view with main, which is expected.

However, if unrelated changes land in main, it could cause the E2E suite to re-run on PRs that don’t touch dashboard/backend, just because the cache was invalid.

This change ensures we always have a stable main cache available for restore, making Turbo smarter and the E2E pipeline more efficient.


This approach was aligned with feedback from Sundar and Krishna. Let me know if anything can be refined!
