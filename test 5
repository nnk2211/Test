Hi Chris,

I went through your comment on the E2E pipeline debt PR. I’ll need a bit more time to go through it carefully. I noted all the points you raised; I did some initial research and captured the key ideas, but I need a bit more time to clearly organize them. I'll update the PR once that's done — thanks for your patience!

Also, there's another PR on Route 53 query logging that’s ready for your review after incorporating previous feedback:
https://github.com/The-Phoenix-Group/ember/pull/1772
Whenever you’re free, could you please take a look?

Thanks!

Would you also like an even slightly more casual or slightly more formal version depending on the tone you want to keep with Chris?
