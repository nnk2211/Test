fix(route53): avoid conflicts by generating unique CloudWatch log groups and resource policies for each Route 53 hosted zone


---

PR Description

Issue

In non-prod (dev) environments, the deployment was failing because multiple Route 53 hosted zones were trying to use the same CloudWatch log group and attach the same CfnResourcePolicy.
This resulted in a conflict error: "LogGroup already exists" or logical ID duplication for the policy.

Resolution

We adopted Option 1 â€” creating a separate log group and resource policy for each hosted zone.
To implement this:

The log group name now includes the environment name, making it unique per environment.

The Route53DnsLoggingResourcePolicy logical ID is also suffixed with envName, ensuring uniqueness across environments.


This resolves the stack conflict and safely enables DNS query logging for each hosted zone.
