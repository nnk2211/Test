Jira Title:

Refactor cd-package-and-stage-code workflow for multi-region deployment support


---

Jira Description:

This task involves updating the cd-package-and-stage-code.yml GitHub Actions workflow to support multi-region deployments across environments.

Scope of the work:

Modify the workflow matrix to support combinations of multiple accounts and regions.

Add an input to optionally select a region during manual workflow dispatch.

Ensure region-specific values are passed correctly to all deployment jobs and shell scripts.

Replace hardcoded default region usages with dynamic values from the matrix.

Update shell scripts to support region as an argument and handle failures explicitly.

Review and update the stageToProduction input handling to align with expected boolean behavior.

PR Title:

Reintroduce GET /logout in Mock SLAL for temporary E2E support


---

PR Description:

Added back the GET /logout route in Mock SLAL to avoid E2E failures.
This is temporary until SLAL infra is fixed and the frontend switches to the new POST-based logout via Ember backend.
Includes a TODO to clean up later.


---

Let me know if you want to include the E2E test suite name or Jira ID.


Sure! Here's a slightly more detailed but still concise version of the PR description:


---

PR Description:

Reintroduced the GET /logout route in the Mock SLAL server to temporarily support the E2E test suite.
The Ember backend and integration tests already use the new POST /logout route, but due to an infrastructure issue on the SLAL API side, the frontend has not yet been updated.
As a result, the E2E tests fail when the frontend calls the old GET /logout endpoint, which no longer exists in the mock.
To prevent test failures, the GET route has been added back with a TODO to remove it once the issue is resolved and the frontend is integrated with the new logout API.
