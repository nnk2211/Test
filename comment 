Sure! Here’s your updated reply with that line added:

Thanks, Chris!

Just to clarify on the script — it does exist in the package.json under root/tests/e2e/package.json as test:pipeline.

The flow I described above was tested thoroughly before pushing the changes, and it worked exactly as expected in all the scenarios.

The reason I retained the name test:pipeline is because there are two related scripts — test:local (for local runs) and test:pipeline (used in GitHub Actions). The pipeline script takes a --pipeline flag, which helps control whether the browser runs in headless mode for CI or headed mode for local.

If we rename it, we might lose that clarity or consistency, but I’m happy to adjust it if you feel a different name would make things more intuitive.
